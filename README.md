# Employee Database Analysis

**Data Modeling**:
Utilized QuickDBD to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) from provided CSV files, enabling a clear understanding of table relationships within the database.

**Data Engineering**:
- Developed table schemas for six CSV datasets, incorporating data types, primary/foreign keys, and pertinent constraints.
- Ensured uniqueness of primary keys; for non-unique keys, composite keys were introduced.
- Orchestrated table creation in an order accommodating foreign keys, followed by CSV data import into respective SQL tables.

**Data Analysis**:
- Extracted specific employee attributes, such as number, name, and salary.
- Retrieved employee details based on hire date, specifically from 1986.
- Enumerated department managers, their affiliations, and personal identifiers.
- Detailed employees by department, highlighting their associations and personal details.
- Identified employees named "Hercules" with last names beginning with "B".
- Showcased members of the Sales and Development teams.
- Tallied employee last names, presenting frequency counts in descending order.
